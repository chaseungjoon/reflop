# Changelog

## 0.1.0 (2026-11-10)

First implementation of PLAN.md milestones M0–M7.

- `reflopd`: rootless setup (`reflopd up`) with a pinned, checksum-verified
  PyTorch runtime (CUDA 13.2, CUDA 12.6 for older drivers and GPUs, or CPU);
  TLS 1.3 daemon mode and SSH pipe mode; pairing with one-time invites; sandboxed
  workers (Landlock, seccomp, namespaces when available, cgroups); safety rails;
  optional quotas; pause, resume, kill, auto-yield and messages; status, top and
  an audit log; `doctor` and `selftest`; Level 1 system install; self-update.
- Worker: validation stages V1–V5 and E1–E3 over opset v1 (582 operators),
  runtime bounds checks, zero-filled allocations, datasets, snapshots.
- Python client: the `reflop` device for PyTorch, lazy capture with views and
  in-place operations, `reflop.capture`, datasets, placement, shim mode for CUDA
  scripts, autocast and GradScaler, the `reflop` CLI.
- `libreflop`: C ABI and a C++ wrapper.
- `install.sh` for both sides, GoReleaser configuration, CI.
